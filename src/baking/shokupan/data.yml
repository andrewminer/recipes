  Japanese Milk Bread is light and fluffy while still having a dense foam-like consistency. It's slightly sweet without
  being a dessert bread. It's ideal for french toast, sandwiches, or just eating plain straight from the oven.

      Place 4 cups of the flour mixture in a mixing bowl. Create a hollow space in the center, and add the pudding and
      the yeast mixture. Mix on slow speed until a dough ball forms. Add more flour mixture as needed 1 tbsp at a time
      until the dough is smooth and satiny. Knead gently a few times, just enough to form a ball.  Lightly grease a
      fresh bowl with butter as well as the dough ball. Place the dough in the bowl, cover with a damp towel, and allow
      to rise in a warm location until doubled in size (about an hour).
