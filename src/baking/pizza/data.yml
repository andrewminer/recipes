      - { amount: 6, unit: "cups", item: "tomato purée (2 per pizza)" }
      - { amount: 12, unit: "oz", item: "mozzerella cheese, shredded (4 per pizza)" }

      Apply sauce, cheese, and your preferred toppings to each of the pizzas.  Then, carefully slide the parchment paper
      with one pizza onto the hot stone, and then slide the parchment paper away, leaving the dough directly on the
      stone.  Return to the oven and bake until the cheese is bubbling and the crust begins to turn golden brown (4–6
      min). Repeat for the remaining pizzas.
