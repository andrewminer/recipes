  This recipe will give you a classic NY-style pizza, but a huge part of the final result is going to come down to the
  quality of the flour, tomato sauce, cheese and toppings you choose... so choose wisely!
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 250, unit: "g", item: "water (110°F–115°F)" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: "g", item: "instant dry yeast" }
      - { amount: 4, unit: "g", item: "sugar" }
    directions: >
      Mix the yeast and sugar in a bowl.  Add the water and set aside until it is foaming (5 min).
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 400, unit: "g", item: "bread flour (Caputo 00 flour, generic 00 flour, or bread flour)" }
      - { amount: 8, unit: "g", item: "salt" }
      - { amount: 1.5, unit: "tsp", item: "olive oil" }
    directions: >
      Combine the flour and salt and blend together.  Create a depression in the center and add the yeast mixture and
      olive oil.  Slowly pull the edges of the "bowl" into the liquid and mix until it forms a single mass of dough.

      Dump out the dough on a lightly-floured counter.  Knead the dough gently, dusting your hands with flour if the
      dough is too sticky, and wetting your hands with warm water if it is too dry.  Ideally, the dough will be smooth,
      stretchy, and just a tiny bit sticky.  Lightly grease a bowl with olive oil, drop in the dough, and cover with
      plastic wrap.  Set aside in a warm (70°F–80°F) place until the dough has doubled in size (about 1 hour).

      Spread out a double-width sheet of parchment paper on the counter, and create a seam by folding it together. Place
      your pizza stone on the paper and mark its outer diameter.  Place the pizza stone in the oven and pre-heat while
      the dough rises.

      Open up the dough as described <a href='https://youtu.be/GtAeKM_f2WU'>here</a>, taking care not to work the dough
      more than needed.  Finish by lightly rolling out the dough with a rolling pin until it reaches the mark indicating
      the edge of your stone.  Curl the outer edge of back toward the center to form the crust.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: "cup", item: "tomato purée" }
      - { amount: 6, unit: "oz", item: "mozzerella cheese, shredded, low-moisture" }
    directions: >
      Apply sauce, cheese, and your preferred toppings to each of the pizzas.  Then, carefully slide the parchment paper
      with one pizza onto the hot stone.  Return to the oven and bake until the cheese is bubbling and the crust begins
      to turn golden brown (4–6 min).
