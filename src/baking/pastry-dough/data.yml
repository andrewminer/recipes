description: >
  This dough forms the basis for pies, tarts, quiches, and other sorts of light crusts.  This recipe makes enough dough
  to line the bottom of a 9” pie dish, so adjust the quantities according to what you intend to make.  It helps a lot to
  chill the butter, shortening, and water ahead of time.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: cup, item: "flour, all-purpose" }
      - { amount: 6, unit: oz, item: "butter, unsalted" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "vegetable shortening" }
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }
      - { amount: 0.125, unit: tsp, item: "sugar, granulated" }
    directions: >
      Add all the ingredients to a mixing bowl and combine with a pastry cutter until pea-sized chunks have formed.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 0.25, unit: cup, item: "water, iced" }
    directions: >
      Pour in about 3/4 of the water and mix quickly with your hand until a contiguous paste has formed.  Keep adding
      water as needed until a smooth and slightly sticky dough has formed.

      Lay out the dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead it by smearing it vigorously about 6” across the surface
      using the heel of your hand.  Then, gather the dough back together, fold it in half, turn it 90°, and repeat.
      Keep this up until completely combined.  Then, place the dough in the center of some waxed paper and cover with
      another piece.  Using a rolling pin, flatten until it is smooth and makes a disc about the same diameter as the
      short side of your paper.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours before using.
