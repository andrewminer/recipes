  When made carefully, English Muffins are the lightest and fluffiest bread you'll ever experience. Slightly singed on
  the tops and bottoms, and all clouds and cotten candy inside.
steps:
  - ingredients:
        - { amount: 1.75, unit: cups, item: "milk, whole" }
        - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "sugar, granulated" }
        - { amount: 2, unit: tsp, item: "yeast, instant" }

      In a saucepan, heat the milk on medium-high heat. Meanwhile, add the yeast and sugar to a small bowl. Once the
      milk reaches 120°F, pour it over the yeast and sugar mixture and set aside until it foams vigorously (about 5
      min).
  - ingredients:
        - { amount: 4.5, unit: cups, item: "flour, bread" }
        - { amount: 1.5, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }
        - { amount: 1, item: "egg" }
        - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "butter (softened)" }
    directions: >
      Add the flour and salt to the bowl of a standing mixer. Lightly whisk to combine.  Make a large hollow in the
      center of the flour, and add the egg, butter, and milk mixture.  Starting with the metal beater attachment, run
      the mixer on low until a dough starts to form (about 1 min), and then switch to the dough hook.  Continue running
      the machine on low until a single ball of dough forms.  If the dough is still crumbly after several minutes, add a
      tbsp of water and run the mixer for several more minutes.  If the dough is still sticky after several minutes, add
      a tbsp of flour instead. Continue adding and waiting until a very soft, slightly sticky dough forms.

      Grease a bowl roughly twice the size of your dough ball with butter, and drop the dough in.  Cover with plastic
      wrap and set aside in a warm place (e.g., an oven set to 100°F).  Wait until the dough has roughly doubled in
      size (about 1 hour).
  - ingredients:
        - { amount: 1, unit: tbsp, item: "semolina or corn meal"}
    directions: >
      Generously sprinkle a electric griddle (turned off) with semolina or corn meal.  Being as gentle as possible,
      divide the dough into 16 small balls, and place them spaced about 1” apart on the griddle.  Cover with parchment
      paper, and allow the dough to rise a second time (about 20 min).  Preheat the oven to 350°F with a pizza stone
      inside.

      Remove the parchment paper, and turn the griddle to low (about 250°F) and cook until the muffins are browned on
      the bottoms (about 7—10 min).  Flip and cook until they reach 200°F in the centers.  If they haven't done so after
      10 min on the second side, transfer them to the pizza stone and bake in the oven until they do.

      Allow the muffins to cool for at least 15 min before eating, and split with a fork before serving.
