  crust.

      - { amount: 1, unit: "tbsp", item: "sugar" }
      - { amount: 1.33, unit: "cups", item: "water (115°F)" }
    directions: >
      In a mixing large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water. Do not stir, but set aside to allow it to mix
      until the top turns foamy (about 5 min). While this is happening, preheat the oven to its lowest setting.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1/2, unit: "cup", item: "olive oil" }

      Using a whish attachment in a standing mixer, add the olive oil, eggs, sugar and salt one at a time, allowing each
      to be mixed fully before adding the next.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 8, unit: "cups", item: "all-purpose flour" }
    directions: >

      On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough by hand until smooth and completely integrated into a single ball.
      Place this into a bowl which is much larger than the dough ball and cover with a damp towel. Turn off the oven,
      and put the bowl inside to rise. The dough should roughly double in size over the course of an hour. Then punch
      down the dough, re-form into a ball, place return to the oven to rise again for about 30 min.

      Divide the dough into six equal portions. Roll each one out into a strand about 12" long and 1½" in diameter.
      Braid three at a time into two loaves, taking care to pinch the ends together firmly. Place both loaves on a
      baking sheet covered with parchment paper and place into the refrigerator to rise again for about an hour.
      Pre-heat the oven to 375°F.

      - { amount: 1, unit: "", item: "egg" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: "tsp", item: "milk (whole)" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: "tbsp", item: "caraway seeds" }
    directions: >
      Mix the egg and milk in a small bowl. Brush the mixture over the two loaves of bread, and then sprinkle the
      caraway seeds over the top. Pop them into the oven and bake until the tops are golden brown (about 20-30 min).
