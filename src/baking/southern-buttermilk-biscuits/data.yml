      Being careful not to overwork the dough, kneed the dough 10 times on a lightly floured surface or until the dough
      just holds together. Roll or pat out into a 14×10" rectangle.  With the short side nearest you, spread 3 tbsp of
      the softened butter over the ⅔ of the surface farthest from you.  Fold the dough in thirds (like a letter) by
      pulling the bottom over the center and then the top third over that. Expect the dough to crack during this
      process. Pat back into a 9×12" rectangle and repeat the same process twice more with another 3 tbsp of the
      softened butter each time. Finally, pat the dough out into a 1" thick rectangle.  Cut the dough into 2-3" squares
      using a scraper and place on a lightly oiled cooking sheet about 1" apart. Brush the tops with the melted butter.
