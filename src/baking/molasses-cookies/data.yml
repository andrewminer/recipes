  Most gluten-free baked goods leave a lot to be desired.  They tend to be crumbly, dry, brittle, or
  all three.  Theses are different.  They're soft, moist, and altogether delicious.  Not only would
  you never guess they're gluten-free, but I think they rank among the best cookies I've ever had.
