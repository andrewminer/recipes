  As a rule, I'm always skeptical of any recipes which tries to mimic something it isn't.  Vegan
  hamburgers, gluten-free muffins, and anything else of the sort almost always disappoints the true
  fan of the original.  Not these muffins.  I was absolutely shocked at how perfectly fluffy,
  delicious, and indestinguishable from the genuine article these muffins were.

      paste.

      While the mixer is still running, add the flour mixture a little at a time, waiting for each
      addition to disappear into the batter before adding another.  Keep adding the flour mix until
      the batter just barely starts to pull away from the side of the bowl.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1.5, unit: cups, item: "blueberries" }
    directions: >
      Turn off the mixer and remove the bowl.  Fold in the blueberries very gently using a rubber
      spatula. Be careful to avoid breaking them.

      Cook for 16–20min, turning the pan once in the middle of the cook time.  The muffins are done
      when they are golden brown on top, and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean.
      Allow the pan to cool for 10min on the counter, then transfer the muffins to a cooling rack
      and allow them to cool for a further 10min.
