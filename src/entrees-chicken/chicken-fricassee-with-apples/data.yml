title: Chicken Fricassee with Apples
timings:
  prep: 30 minutes
icons: [gluten-free]
servings: 6
description: >
  This is a delicate dish with a lot of mild flavors which blend into a creamy sauce which becomes slightly sweet from
  the apples, and slighly tart from the vinegar, but only just a hint of both.  The thin slices of breaded and sautéed
  chicken keep it from being too chewy, and providing a great platform for the sauce and apples.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, item: "apples, Honeycrisp & Granny Smith" }
    directions: >
      Cut the apples in to 16ths, taking care to cut out the hard parts of the core. Leave the skins on.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 4, item: "chicken breasts, skinless, boneless" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "pepper, black" }
      - { amount: 0.25, unit: cup, item: "gluten-free flour blend" }
    directions: >
      Pat the chicken dry and slice in half along the thickness of the breast to create two even halves about ¾” thick.
      Season with salt and pepper and then dredge in a shallow dish containing the flour.  Shake off the excess flour
      and set aside.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "butter, unsalted" }
    directions: >
      Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the foam subsides, drop in the apples. Cook, taking
      care to evenly brown both sides of each apple slice. They will only brown slightly, but you can tell they are done
      when they start to become translucent at the edges. When done, set aside for later.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: tbsp, item: "butter, unsalted" }
    directions: >
      Using the same skillet, melt some more butter and wait until it foams. Lightly brown the chicken on each side,
      (about 2 minutes per side) working in batches, if necessary. Set aside until needed.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: cup, item: "onion (diced)" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tsp, item: "thyme, fresh (leaves only)" }
    directions: >
      Using the same skillet, sautée the onion and thyme until golden and translucent (5–7 minutes).
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: cup, item: "apple cider" }
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: cup, item: "chicken stock" }
    directions: >
      Add the cider and stock and bring to a boil.  Return the chicken to the skillet and reduce the heat to a simmer.
      Cover and cook until the chicken reaches 160°F (8–12 minutes).
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: cup, item: "heavy cream" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tsp, item: "vinegar, apple cider" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tbsp, item: "chives, fresh (minced)" }
    directions: >
      Transfer the chicken to a covered serving dish.  Add the cream, and cook on high, stirring constantly, until
      reduced to the desired thickness (about 2 minutes). Stir in the vinegar and any chicken juices from the serving
      dish. Bring up to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer for a few minutes.
