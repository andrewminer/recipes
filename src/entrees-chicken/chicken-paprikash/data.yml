  This is a simple, fast, and delicious preparation for chicken that makes for an excellent weeknight dinner.  I use
  chicken breasts so no one has to negotiate bones, but boneless thighs would work just as well.  I like to serve it on
  a bed of egg noodles with a vegetable on the side.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 4, unit: lb, item: "chicken breasts (skinned, chopped)" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tsp, item: "salt, coarse" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "pepper, black" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "oil, high-heat" }
    directions: >
      Heat the oil in a Dutch oven until shimmering hot.  Season the chicken with salt and pepper and brown in batches
      so as not to crowd the chicken.  Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside to keep warm.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, item: "onions (sliced)" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "garlic (minced)" }
    directions: >
      Sauté the onions in the remaining oil until soft and translucent.  Add the garlic and sauté for a minute or two
      longer.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "flour, gluten-free" }
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "paprika, sweet Hungarian" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: cups, item: "stock, chicken" }
    directions: >
      Reduce the heat to low and add the flour and paprika.  Cook until the paprikia is fragrant (3–5 min). Add the
      stock slowly, stirring constantly until smooth.  Return the chicken to the pan, and cook until the chicken is
      cooked all the way through (about 10 min).
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: cup, item: "sour cream" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "parsley, fresh (minced)" }
    directions: >
      Remove the chicken pieces to a serving platter.  Skim the remaining fat on the surface of the broth.  Reduce until
      thickened slightly, and then add the sour cream.  Heat, but do not allow to boil.  Pour the sauce over the chicken
      and sprinkle with parsley to serve.
