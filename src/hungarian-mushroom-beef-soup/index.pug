                    This soup combines a smooth, rich broth with soft chunks of beef and just a little bit of zing from
                    the paprika for an absolutly luxurious overall experience whether as a stand-alone dinner or as a
                    supplement to another dish.

                .detail.
                    While the meat is nearly done simmering (about 10 min remaining), add butter to a large saucepan and
                    heat on medium until it foams. Add flour gradually while whisking continously, taking care to mix it
                    in completely.

                    Stir in milk gradually, while continuing to whisk continuously. Take care to completely remove any
                    lumps. Continue to whisk until the roux thickens and then add it to the soup pot.

                            .item sour cream
                .detail.
                    Once the meat is tender (after roughly an hour simmering), add the lemon juice, sour cream, and
                    adjust the spices to taste (adding more paprika to the desired level of heat).
