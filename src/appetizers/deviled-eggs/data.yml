  Deviled eggs are one of my favorite appetizers, and very easy to make. If you like to hurry the process along, buy
  hard-boiled eggs from the grocery store so you can skip straight to the last step.

      Place the eggs in a medium-sized pot, cover with 1" of water, and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as it
      gets to a rolling boil, turn off the heat and allow the pot to rest. While it is resting, fill a
      large bowl with ice and water (1 ice cube per egg). After the eggs have rested for 10 minutes, transfer them to
      the ice water.

      Peel the eggs, and very carefully slice in half with a sharp knife. Gently pop out the yolks into mixing bowl, and
      set the whites aside on a platter.  Add the the remaining ingredients and whisk until creamy and smooth. Transfer
      the mixture into a pastry bag (or a ziploc bag with a corner cut off).  Gently squeeze the bag and pipe the
      mixture into the remaining egg halves. Dust the finished eggs with paprika.
