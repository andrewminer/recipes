  Stirring a packet of onion soup mix into sour cream has long been the go-to method for this popular party dip; we were
  determined to do better. By dicing onions instead of slicing them (more surface area) and starting them over medium
  heat, we create deep color and caramelized flavor in only 30 minutes. A base of sour cream and mayonnaise provides
  balanced flavor and creaminess, and a pinch of cayenne adds heat, while balsamic vinegar lends sweetness and mellow
  tang.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "butter, unsalted" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: lbs, item: "onions, yellow (diced)" }
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: tsp, item: "black pepper" }
      - { amount: 0.125, unit: tsp, item: "cayenne pepper" }
    directions: >
      Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Cook, stirring
      occasionally, until the onions are translucent (about 10 minutes). Reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue to
      cook until the onions are golden (about 10 minutes).

      Add 2 tbsp of water to the skillet, and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until the water has evaporated (about
      5 minutes).  Add the remaining water and cook until the onions are caramelized and the water has again evaporated
      (about 5 more minutes).
