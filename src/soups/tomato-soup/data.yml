  This tomato soup is thick, slighly creamy, and very hearty.  Unlike store-bought tomato soup, it's also not
  overburdened with sugar to make it taste good. Instead, I use canned San Marzano tomatoes (often kept in a separate
  section in the supermarket) as they add a whole different dimension to any tomato dish than even fresh tomatoes grown
  in the US.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, item: "28oz cans diced tomatoes" }
      - { amount: 0.75, unit: cup, item: "chicken broth" }
    directions: >
      Drain the tomatoes into a colander over a large pot, pressing lightly to release the liquid. Add the chicken broth
      to the tomato juice and set aside.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "butter, unsalted" }
      - { amount: 1, item: "onion, yellow (chopped)" }
      - { amount: 1, item: "bay leaf" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "sugar, brown" }
    directions: >
      Melt the butter in a dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent. Add ⅔ of the
      tomatoes, bay leaf, and brown sugar.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes begin to brown (about 5
      minutes).
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "tomato paste" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "flour, gluten-free mix" }
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: tsp, item: "baking soda" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }
    directions: >
      Add the tomato paste and flour to the pot. Continue cooking, stirring frequently now, until the paste begins to
      darken. Slowly stir in the reserved tomato juice mixture, the remaining tomatoes, baking soda, and salt. Bring to
      a boil, and then reduce to medium-low heat to simmer until slightly thickened (about 5 minutes). Then, remove from
      the heat.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: cup, item: "heavy cream" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "black pepper" }
    directions: >
      Discard the bay leaf. Purée the soup in batches in a large blender.  Return the puréed soup to the pot and bring
      back to a low simmer.  Add the heavy cream and pepper.
