  One of the most delightful treats when travelling in Italy is to have fresh Limoncello available after nearly every
  meal! Fortunately, it's quite simple to make your own at home, so you can always have it available there as well.

      zest have been completely removed, and only liquid remains.  For storage, pour into bottles with an airtight
      stopper.
