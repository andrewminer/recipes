  Zesty, tangy, sweet, and altogether marvelous.  It is, however, a lot of preparation and work to cook, so it's not one
  you'll want to make except for a special treat.

      Fill the bottom of a large skillet with ¼” of a high-heat frying oil. Heat until quite hot. Working in batches,
      fry the chicken until crisp and lightly browned on all sides. Once cooked, set aside the chicken on a plate lined

      Mix the cornstarch and water in a small dish. Drain the skillet of oil and wipe clean. Pour in half of the

      Reduce the marinade until it is the desired thickness.  Then add in the reserved chicken and cook until heated
      through.
