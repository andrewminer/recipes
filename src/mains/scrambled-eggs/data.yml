description: >
  This recipe has been in my family for at least 4 generations that I'm aware of, and possibly more. The resulting
  eggs are rich and creamy—almost a custard—with little spots of cream cheese still unmelted and waiting to be
  found...
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 9, item: "eggs (large)" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: "tbsp", item: "half-n-half" }
    directions: >
      Whisk the eggs and half-n-half together in a mixing bowl until completely homogeneous in texture and color.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: "tbsp", item: "butter" }
    directions: >
      Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Once it starts to foam, reduce heat to very low and pour in the egg
      mixture. Allow to cook slowly, stirring frequently, taking care to constantly lift the bottom layer of egg off the
      pan.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 3, unit: "oz", item: "cream cheese" }
      - { unit: "~", item: "celery salt" }
    directions: >
      Cut the cream cheese into ½” cubes and set aside until the eggs have started to firm up. When bare patches are
      first left behind by stirring the eggs, add in the cream cheese chunks and fold them into the eggs very gently: do
      not mix them. Continue gently folding the eggs until they the liquid has only just evaporated. Season with celery
      salt and serve hot.
