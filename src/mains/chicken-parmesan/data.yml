  A delicious Italian breaded chicken smothered with cheese and tomato-based pasta sauce!
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 6, item: chicken breasts (skinless, boneless) }
      - { amount: 2, item: eggs }
      - { amount: 1, unit: cup, item: Parmesean cheese (finely grated) }
      - { amount: 7, unit: oz, item: bread crumbs (very finely crumbled) }
    directions: >
      Pour beaten eggs into a shallow dish. Mix the bread crumbs and cheese in another shallow dish.  After washing and
      drying the chicken breasts, dredge them first in the egg, and then in the bread crumb mixture. Place aside on
      parchment paper.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: vegetable oil }
    directions: >
      In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. When hot, add the chicken and saute until golden brown on both
      sides and the chicken is cooked through (about 8–10 minutes per side).
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 12, unit: oz, item: pasta sauce }
      - { amount: 6, unit: slices, item: Monterey Jack cheese }
    directions: >
      Pour tomato sauce into an oven-safe dish just big enough to hold the chicken. Place the chicken on top of the
      sauce, and place a slice of cheese over each breast. Cook at 375°F until the cheese has melted and just started to
      brown (about 20 minutes).
