  Most BBQ pork ribs are covered in sticky sweet sauce mostly made up of brown sugar and spices.  This obviously does
  not work for a ketogenic diet. This recipe substitutes the sweet sauce for a tangy mustard-based sauce for a very
  tasty alternative.

      Seal each segment of ribs in foil and place on the rack of a roasting pan. Fill the bottom of the pan with water
      (until just below the rack), and place in the oven to cook at 300°F until the internal temperature of the ribs
      (directly next to the bone) reaches 160°F (about an hour).

      Unpack each packet and lay the ribs out on a cooking sheet. Place under a broiler on the highest setting until a
      crusty brown bark begins to form. This will happen at a different rate for each piece so you'll need to watch them
      carefully!
