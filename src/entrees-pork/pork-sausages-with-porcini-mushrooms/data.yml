  While the recipe is deceptively simple, the intense rich flavor of the mushrooms, wine and sausage
  completely took me by surprise the first time I made this dish.  It's since become a family
  favorite in my house.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: oz, item: "mushrooms, dried porcini" }
    directions: >
      Soak the mushrooms in barely-warm water for at least 30min.  When done soaking, squeeze the
      excess water from the mushrooms by hand, retaining every drop of water from both soaking and
      squeezing.  Rise the mushrooms several times, taking care to dislodge any bits of dirt.
      Strain the soaking water through a fine sieve and set aside.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: tbsp, item: "olive oil, extra virgin" }
      - { amount: 1.5, unit: lbs, item: "pork sausage, mild" }
    directions: >
      Using a sautÃ© pan large enough to hold all the sausages in a single layer, get the oil
      shimmering hot, and add the sausages. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until they have
      browned all over.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: cup, item: "wine, dry red" }
    directions: >
      Uncover the pan, add the red wine, and reduce the temperature to a simmer.  Continue to turn
      the sausages from time to time until the wine has disappeared.  Then add the liquid retained
      from soaking the mushrooms.  Bring to a boil, and reduce to a simmer.  Cover, and continue
      cooking, taking time to turn the sausages and scrape up all the browned bits from time to time
      until the liquid has nearly disappeared as well.
  - ingredients: []
    directions: >
      Once nearly all the liquid is gone, remove the sausages to a serving platter.  Separate the
      oils from the sauce, and pour the sauce over the sausages.  Use the oil for mixing with
      polenta or mashed potatoes.
