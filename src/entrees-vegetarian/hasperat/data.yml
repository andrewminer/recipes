  Hasperat is a fictional food eaten by the Bajorans from Star Trek.  It is described as quite spicy with a brine so
  strong as to sear the tongue and make the eyes water.  It is usually shown wrapped in a flat bread.  No official
  recipe has ever been published, so this is my personal take on it, inspired by a receipe I found online.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 3, unit: cups, item: "water" }
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "salt, coarse" }
      - { amount: 2, item: "pepper, red bell" }
      - { amount: 2, item: "pepper, poblano" }
      - { amount: 5, item: "pepper, habañero" }
      - { amount: 2, item: "onion, red" }
    directions: >
      Bring the water and salt to a boil while you dice the vegetables.  Once the water is boiling vigorously, drop in
      the vegetables and boil for until soft (about 15 min).
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 6, unit: cups, item: "spinach, lightly packed" }

      Drop the spinach on top of the mixture and cook, covered, until the spinach has wilted completely (about 5 min).

      - { amount: 1, unit: cup, item: "vinegar, white" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: cup, item: "vinegar, apple cider" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "wasabi powder" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "sriracha" }
    directions: >
      Stir in the spinach and add the vinegar and spices.  Cook for a few more minutes and then transfer to a sealed
      container.  Put the whole thing aside to brine for 24–48 hours.

      Strain the vegetables while retaining the brine.  Run the vegetables through a food processor adding just enough
      brine to create a thick paste.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 6, item: "tortillas, large" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: cups, item: "hummus" }
    directions: >
      Spread a thin layer of hummus across each tortilla, and add few tablespoons of the paste to the center of the
      tortilla (depending upon it's size).  Fold and roll the tortilla in the same fashion as a buritto.  Cut in half
      and serve.
