  Gnocchi is a delicate potato-based form of pasta. When prepared well, each piece is light and fluffy, and a perfect
  delight whether served with a flavorful sauce (e.g., pesto, marinara) or simply on its own with a little butter.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, unit: lbs, item: "potatoes, yukon gold (roughly chopped)" }
    directions: >
      Bring a pot of water to a boil and drop in the potatoes. Cook until tender (about 10 minutes). Then drain the
      water and mash the potatoes.  Allow the potatoes to cool until they aren't too warm to handle.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, unit: cups, item: "flour, all-purpose" }
      - { amount: 1, item: "egg" }
    directions: >
      Combine the potatoes, flour, and egg in a large mixing bowl.  Knead until the dough forms a ball.  On a floured
      surface, roll out small portions of the dough into long, Â½" diameter cylinders.  Cut these into 1" segments and
      set aside.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }
    directions: >
      Bring a pot of lightly-salted water to a boil and drop in the gnocchi a handful at a time. They will sink to the
      bottom initially, but then rise to the surface when fully cooked. Use a skimmer to remove them when the rise to
      the surface.
