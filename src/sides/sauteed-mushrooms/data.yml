  These are the best sauteed mushrooms I've ever had. Slighly salty, and very savory, they serve very well as a topping
  for steak, baked potatoes and whatever else needs a strong flavor.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "olive oil" }
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "butter" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: lb, item: "button mushrooms (sliced)" }
    directions: >
      Heat the olive oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until it foams. Add the mushrooms and cook
      until reduced somewhat in size and slightly yellowed (about 5 minutes).
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: clove, item: "garlic" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tbsp, item: "tamair (or soy sauce)" }
      - { amount: 1/4, unit: tsp, item: "garlic salt" }
      - { unit: ~, item: "black pepper" }
    directions: >
      Add the remaining ingredients and cook until the mushrooms are slightly browned and the sauced thickened (about
      5-10 minutes).
