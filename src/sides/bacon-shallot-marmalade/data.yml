  This marmalade has a lot going on!  Salty, tangy, sweet, and positively delicious.  I've used it to augment beef,
  lamb, and other strong-flavored dishes.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: lb, item: "bacon (diced)" }
    directions: >
      Fry the bacon on medium high heat until it has released all its fat and become crispy. Set aside in a small bowl.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: lb, item: "shallots (julienned)" }
    directions: >
      SautÃ©e the shallots in the bacon grease until lightly carmelized. Once finished, add the shallots to the bowl with
      the bacon.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: cup, item: "vinegar, balsamic" }
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: tsp, item: "pepper, black" }
    directions: >
      Deglaze the pan with the vinegar, salt, and pepper.  Reduce the vinegar to approximately half the volume (so that
      a spoon passed through the pan leaves a clear streak).  Pour the vinegar in with rest and mix well.
