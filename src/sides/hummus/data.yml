  Fresh hummus is pretty amazing stuff, but you'll definitely need a powerful blender or food processor to manage as it
  gets very thick by the end.  This recipe deliberately keeps it very simple, but hummus is a great platform to
  experiment with adding various other flavors (e.g., red pepper flakes, dill, etc.).
