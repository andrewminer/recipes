  Harissa is not merely a hot, pepper sauce; its delightfully exotic blend of spices brings a special dimension to it
  beyond mere heat.  It's a wonderful addition to liven up other dishes, or merely to be eaten on its own with bread
  or crackers.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, item: "peppers, red bell" }
    directions: >
      Pre-heat the oven's broiler and move the rack one step from the top.  Line a baking sheet with foil, and lay out
      the red peppers, halved, with the skins up.  Cook until they just start to blacken on top (about 5 min), and then
      seal in a bowl with plastic wrap and set aside.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 6, item: "peppers, fresno" }
      - { amount: 1, item: "peppers, habañero" }
    directions: >
      Bring a pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Drop the whole peppers into the water and boil until soft (about 3
      min). Drain the pot, and let the peppers cool until safe to handle.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 0.25, unit: tsp, item: "caraway seeds" }
      - { amount: 0.25, unit: tsp, item: "coriander seeds" }
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: tsp, item: "cumin, ground" }
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: tsp, item: "mint, dried" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "garlic (minced)" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "lemon juice" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tbsp, item: "olive oil" }
    directions: >
      In a dry skillet, roast the seeds until they brown a bit and start to smell fragrant (about 2 min).  Use a spice
      grinder or small food processor to blend the seeds and remaining dry spices until the mixture is homogenous. Dice
      all the peppers (red bell, fresno, and habañero).  Drop everything except the olive oil into a blender and purée
      until smooth. Add the olive oil just at the end, and pulse just enough to mix it.
