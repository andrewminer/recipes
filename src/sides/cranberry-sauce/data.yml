  This receipe for cranberry sauce is perfect because it's not too tart, and not too sweet, and allows the berries full
  scope to speak for themselves.  This approach produces a clear gelatinous sauce (called jellied cranberry sauce in
  the US) without any actual gelatin, and the by-product of a jam-like cranberry mash.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 12, unit: oz, item: "cranberries, fresh" }
    directions: >
      Wash the berries and discard any which are split, soft, or crushed.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: cup, item: "sugar, granulated" }
      - { amount: 0.75, unit: cup, item: "water" }
      - { amount: 0.25, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }

      Bring the water, sugar, and salt to a boil over high heat.  Add the cranberries, and bring back to a boil.  Reduce
      the heat to medium and continue cooking until most of the berries have burst open and the sauce is thick enough
      to coat a spoon (about 5â€“10min).

    directions: >
      Pour everything through a wire mesh strainer into a bowl.  Using a wooden spoon, mash the berries, forcing all the
      liquid possible through the strainer.  Transfer the liquid portion to the refrigerator (where it will solidify
      into a jelly), and set aside the mashed pulp for other uses.
