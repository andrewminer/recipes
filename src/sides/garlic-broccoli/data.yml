description: >
  Broccoli is one of those vegetables which some people like raw, and some people like cooked: but only with a lot of
  added flavor. Not a lot of people like plain, steamed broccoli.  This dish splits the different very successfully. A
  bit of light steaming sofens the broccoli without turning it into bitter mush, and the marinade adds all the flavor
  you could want.
