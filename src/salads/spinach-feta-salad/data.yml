  This salad is extremely simple to make and very tasty.  It is my go-to salad for when I'm in a hurry or have a lot of
  other dishes in progress at the same time. It's improved by chilling for a while before serving.

      Wash the spinach and place in a large serving bowl.  Add the cheese and cranberries, and then the oil and vinegar.
      Toss by hand so that the cheese is somewhat pulverized and mixed into the oil and vinegar.
