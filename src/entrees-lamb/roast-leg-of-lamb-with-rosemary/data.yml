  The trick to a really good leg of lamb is to get it as fresh as possible, and to avoid overcooking it.  Both will help
  avoid the overly gamey flavor that some people object to in lamb. Done correctly, though, it makes for a rich and
  delightful change from beef or pork.

      Pre-heat the oven to 450°F. Place the leg of lamb on the rack of a roasting pan, and add enough water to come just
      below the rack. Sprinkle the roast with salt, and then tent it with foil.  Place the roasting pan in the oven to
      cook until the internal temperature reaches 130°F (about 45 minutes).

      oven, and allow to rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes before carving.
