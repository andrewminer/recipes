    directions: >
      Pre-heat the oven to 375°F while you prepare the lamb.<br /><br />

      Consider the rack as a series of lower-case b's connected together where the upright portion is the "stem", and
      the round portion is the "body".  Trim the fat along the stems until it nearly reaches the body, leaving the bone
      exposed.  Make cuts in the meat to separate the body of each 'b' from the next, while leaving the stem of each
      fully connected.<br /><br />

      Bend both racks into semicircles with stems in the center of the circle, and the bodies on the outside.  Place
      them next to one another to form a complete circle, and use kitchen twine around the bodies to hold everything
      together.  Add a second round of twine around the base of the stems to add more support.
