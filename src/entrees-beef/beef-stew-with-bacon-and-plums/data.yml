  This delightfully rich and savory stew is a close cousin of the much more famous Beef Bourguignon. Except, instead of
  pearl onions and mushrooms, this stew features butternut squash and dried plums. In anything, it's even more
  spectacular than its cousin as the squash and plums add sweet notes which complement the rich savoriness of the beef
  and bacon.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 3.5, unit: lb, item: "beef, chuck roast" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tbsp, item: "salt, coarse" }
    directions: >
      Trim and cut the roast into large, bite-sized pieces. Sprinkle evenly with salt, cover, and chill overnight.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 6, unit: oz, item: "bacon, smoked, thick-cut" }
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "olive oil" }
    directions: >
      Preheat the oven to 450°F. Cut the bacon into lardons and fry in a skillet with the olive oil until all the fat
      has been rendered, and the remaining meat is well browned.  Reserve the bacon grease. Dry the bacon meat with
      paper towels and set aside.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 4, unit: cup, item: "butternut squash (1” cubes)" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "butter, unsalted" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "salt, coarse" }
    directions: >
      Place the squash in a large baking dish and cover with 1 tbsp of bacon grease, and 1 tbsp of melted butter.
      Sprinkle with salt and toss to coat the squash evenly. Place, uncovered, in the oven and roast until tender and
      starting to singe on top (20—30 min), stirring once in the middle. Transfer to a large bowl, cover, and set aside.
      Then reduce the oven to 275°F.
  - ingredients:
    directions: >
      While the squash cooks, add the remaining bacon grease and olive oil to the skillet, and heat until shimmering.
      Meanwhile, dry the beef completely with paper towels. Brown the beef in batches, taking care not to overcrowd the
      skillet.  Once browned, set the beef aside.  Reserve 1 tbsp of the hot oil in the pan, discarding the rest.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, item: "leek" }
    directions: >
      Cut the leek in half lengthwise, and reserve a few stalks from the center-most layer.  Dice the remainder of the
      white portion of the leek, discarding the green.  Set the prepared white portions aside.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2, unit: cup, item: "onions, yellow (diced)" }
      - { amount: 1, unit: tsp, item: "salt, coarse" }
      - { amount: 3, unit: tsp, item: "garlic (minced)" }
    directions: >
      Add 1 tbsp of butter to the reserved hot oil. Once the butter foams, add the onions, sprinkle with salt, and
      sautée. Use the butter and oil to deglaze the skillet as the onions cook.  When the onions have just started to
      soften (2–3 min), add diced leeks and garlic.  Sprinkle with salt, and cook until the onions are completely soft
      and translucent (3–4 min). Add the mixture to the baking dish formerly used for the squash.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 2.75, unit: cup, item: "red wine, Pinot Noir" }
    directions: >
      Add the red wine to the skillet and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat slightly, and continue boiling until the
      volume has reduced by half. Add the reserved beef to the baking dish with the onions, and cover with the wine
      reduction.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, item: "cinnamon stick (crushed)" }
      - { amount: 2, item: "cloves, whole" }
      - { amount: 7, item: "peppercorns, whole" }
      - { amount: 5, unit: stems, item: "parsley, fresh" }
    directions: >
      Prepare a sachet containing the cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns with string and cheese cloth.  Separately, tie
      the parsley stems and leek centers together.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 3, item: "bay leaves" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "tomato paste" }
      - { amount: 0.25, unit: tsp, item: "thyme, dried" }
      - { amount: 1.5, unit: cup, item: "chicken stock" }
    directions: >
      Tuck the completed sachet and the bay leaves under the beef layer near the center of the dish, leaving the string
      hanging out over the edge.  Add tiny dollops of tomato paste all around.  Sprinkle thyme over everything, and
      place the leek & parsley stems on top.  Add enough chicken stock to just cover the contents of the baking dish.
      Cover tightly with foil, and place in the oven on a baking sheet.  Cook for 2 hours.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1, unit: cup, item: "prunes, pitted" }
      - { amount: 0.25, unit: cup, item: "parsley, fresh (minced)" }
    directions: >
      Uncover the baking sheet, and add the prunes in a single layer on top. Cover again, and bake until the meat is
      easy pierced with a knife (about 45 min). Uncover, skim the fat layer (if any), and remove the sachet, parsley
      bundle, and bay leaves.  Add the squash, and bake uncovered for a further 20 min, basting occasionally.  Sprinkle
      with fresh parsley to serve.
