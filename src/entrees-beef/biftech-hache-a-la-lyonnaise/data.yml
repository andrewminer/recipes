  These are the most amazing hamburgers you will have in your entire life.  I enjoy a good
  hamburger, but the American variety can't hold a candle to these amazing delights.  The (very
  French) combination of plenty of butter, a generous splash of vermouth, and delicate handling put
  these in a category by themselves.
steps:
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 0.75, unit: cup, item: "onion, yellow (minced)" }
      - { amount: 3, unit: tbsp, item: "butter, unsalted" }
    directions: >
      Cook the onion slowly in butter until transparent, but not browned. Set aside in a mixing
      bowl.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 1.5, unit: lb, item: "ground beef, 10% fat" }
      - { amount: 1.5, unit: tsp, item: "salt" }
      - { amount: 0.125, unit: tsp, item: "pepper, black" }
      - { amount: 0.125, unit: tsp, item: "thyme" }
      - { amount: 1, item: "egg" }
    directions: >
      Add the beef, butter, salt, pepper, thyme, and the egg to the mixing bowl and combine by hand
      until a smooth paste has formed.
  - ingredients: []
    directions: >
      Form 6oz patties about 3/4" thick.  Set aside on parchment paper.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: cup, item: "flour, gluten-free" }
    directions: >
      Spread the flour in a shallow dish, and dredge each patty until coated.  Shake off any excess
      and place them back on the paper.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 6, unit: tbsp, item: "oil, safflower" }
    directions: >
      Heat the oil in a skillet large enough to accomodate all the hamburgers in a single layer.
      Once the oil is shimmering hot, place the patties down in a single layer. DO NOT touch them
      until they have browned half-way up the sides (about 2–3 min).
  - ingredients: []
    directions: >
      Very gently, turn the patties over and continue to sauté them until browned fully up the
      sides (another 2–3 min).  DO NOT touch them at all while they cook, and handle them as little
      as possible while turning.
  - ingredients:
      - { amount: 0.5, unit: cup, item: "vermouth" }
      - { amount: 2, unit: tbsp, item: "butter, unsalted" }
    directions: >
      Gently transfer the patties to a platter and leave in a warm place.  Discard the fat in the
      skillet, and add the vermouth.  Reduce it until it coats the back of a spoon, and then melt in
      the final portion of butter.  Reduce just a bit further, and the pour the sauce over the
      patties and serve.
