Starting with the metal beater attachment, run the mixer on low until a dough starts to form (about 1 min), and then switch to the dough hook.  Continue running the machine on low until a single ball of dough forms.  If the dough is still crumbly after several minutes, add a tbsp of water and run the mixer for several more minutes.  If the dough is still sticky after several minutes, add a tbsp of flour instead. Continue adding and waiting until a very soft, slightly sticky dough forms.
